# SkyStorn

**SkyStorn** is a file-sending application where **clients also act as servers**, storing and distributing files to other clients using **WiFi Connect**. It enables easy and fast file sharing without relying on a central server â€” it's device-to-device.

## Description

SkyStorn is a lightweight and efficient app for sending and receiving files over a local network. Unlike traditional systems, any connected client also works as a server, creating a decentralized file-sharing network.

### How it works

- Devices connect via **WiFi Connect**
- One client shares a file
- Other clients on the same network can view and download the file directly
- The system scales naturally as more devices connect

## Use Cases

- Quickly share files in classrooms, events, or offices
- Distribute files in areas without internet access
- Create temporary file-sharing networks among friends
